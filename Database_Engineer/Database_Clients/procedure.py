## We should note that we presume mysql cursor obj
## here in run and evaluate. Obviously, this being a
## mysql procedure, we would never execure it in a process
## having a __CONNECTION__ to a psql database. How can
## we express this within the code? Is there a way
## to extend MySQLProcedure class with a MySQL
## super containing generic names for the specific
## methods used here? ie. stored_results, fetchall
## and callproc? Cursors should be database specific
## as Procedures and Queries are... ? 

## The Procedure, Query, Connection and Cursor should
## all subclass MySQL, even if it's just symbolic. Then
## in Process, we can verify they're all of the same 
## 'Database'. Process then is generic over Databases
## Notice line 15 in process.py. There's no gauruntee 
## that connection obj has cursor property/method. 

## Is this really worth working on? Just finish the
## problem...
